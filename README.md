# **GO!**

Yes it’s time to white-board, to code, to troubleshoot bugs, to re-code, to solve other bugs, to refactor, etc..

Development is not a long quiet river, but it can be really fun!

Starting today, you are building **YOUR** project - be proud of it!

# **Evaluation - Show off!**

After the pitch, now you will code - nice right? However don’t forget that you will have to prepare your presentation and share it to your technical mentors.
